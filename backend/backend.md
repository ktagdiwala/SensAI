# Backend Setup
`npm install` in the `backend` directory to install dependencies.

Run `node app.js` to start the backend server.

Ensure the `.env` file is configured with the correct database credentials (DB_HOST, DB_USER, DB_PASS, PORT). It should be in the backend folder and added to `.gitignore` to prevent sensitive information from being committed.
